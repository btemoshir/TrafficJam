Dear Mr. Dormy, Mr. van Houcke and Ms. Gabrie, 

In this archive you will find our project on the WLR equation. The work is 
best viewed using the HTML format, as it shows code, animations and text exactly 
as we inteded. Included you will find:

- The HTML file (recommended)
- The Jupyter notebook
- The associated .py file
- A PDF of the report created using LateX (no animations unfortunately)

If the animations in the Jupyter notebook don't work, please run this piece of 
code in the Anaconda Prompt. It installs the ffmpeg codec, which fixed our issues:

conda install -c menpo ffmpeg


We hope that you will enjoy our work,

Moshir Harsh & Rob Hesselink
